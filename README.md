# React Lessons

Welcome to `React`, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Our goal for this unit is to learn and build apps using component-based design through React.js. Not only will we provide you with the knowledge necessary to build a React application, but also the conventions and best practices that create sustainable code. Lessons and lesson order are subject to change at any time depending on our progress in club meetings.
